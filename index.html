                <p class="faq-answer">Yes — every note gets two layers of protection. First, all notes are automatically encrypted with AES-256 the moment they're saved. This happens behind the scenes — you don't have to do anything. Second, you can add an extra layer of AES-256 encryption to individual notes for even more security. Your encryption key never leaves your device and is stored in a secure area of your phone that even other apps can't access. And since Scrib never connects to the internet, your notes can't be intercepted, leaked, or sent anywhere — ever.</p>

                <summary class="faq-question">What is the Private Vault?</summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Private Vault is a separate, PIN-protected space for your most sensitive notes. Vault notes don't appear in the main notes list — they're only accessible after entering your PIN. You can move any note to or from the Vault at any time.</p>
