            <p>Your notes are more personal than you think. Passwords, journal entries, medical info, business ideas, things you haven't told anyone. Most people dump all of this into Google Keep without a second thought.</p>

            <p>People deserve to know what happens to their data — and what the alternative looks like.</p>

            <h2>Where Google Keep Stores Your Notes</h2>

            <p>Google Keep saves everything to Google's cloud servers. That's how it syncs across your phone, tablet, and browser. Convenient — but it comes with trade-offs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google can access your notes.</strong> They hold the encryption keys to your data. Your notes aren't end-to-end encrypted — they're encrypted on Google's servers with keys Google manages.</li>
                <li><strong>Your notes are tied to your Google account.</strong> If someone gets into your account — through a phishing attempt, a password breach, a compromised recovery email — they get your notes too.</li>
                <li><strong>Law enforcement can request them.</strong> Google complies with valid legal data requests. Per their own <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transparency report</a>, they receive hundreds of thousands of requests per year.</li>
                <li><strong>Data breaches happen.</strong> No company is immune. Cloud storage means your data exists on servers you don't control, in data centers you'll never visit.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's how cloud-based note apps work. Convenient — but the cost is control over your own data.</p>

            <h2>What "Encrypted" Actually Means</h2>

            <p>The word "encrypted" gets thrown around constantly in app marketing. Here's what actually matters:</p>

            <p><strong>AES-256</strong> is the encryption standard used by the U.S. government, banks, and the military. It's not a marketing buzzword — it's math. A 256-bit encryption key has more possible combinations than there are atoms in the observable universe. No one is brute-forcing that. Not today, not in our lifetimes.</p>

            <p>But here's the part most apps don't tell you: <strong>encryption only protects you if you hold the key.</strong> If the company holds your encryption key (which is how most cloud apps work), they can decrypt your data whenever they need to. That's not end-to-end encryption — it's a locked door where the landlord keeps a copy of the key.</p>

            <p>Real encryption means the key lives on your device and nowhere else.</p>

            <h2>Why I Built Scrib</h2>

            <p>I'm Beeswax Pat — indie developer, U.S. Army veteran. I built <a href="https://scrib.cfd/">Scrib</a> because I couldn't find a notes app that met four simple requirements:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Never connects to the internet.</strong> Not "optionally offline." There is no server. No sync feature. No cloud. The app doesn't have networking code in it.</li>
                <li><strong>Encrypts everything automatically.</strong> Every note is AES-256 encrypted the moment it's saved — that's the base layer, always on. On top of that, you can toggle per-note encryption for your most sensitive notes as a second layer.</li>
                <li><strong>Keeps the key on your device.</strong> The encryption key is generated on your phone and stored in the Android Keystore — a hardware-backed secure area that other apps can't access.</li>
                <li><strong>No account required.</strong> No email. No phone number. No sign-up. Open the app and write.</li>
            </ol>

            <figure>
                <img src="../vault-pin.jpg" alt="Scrib Private Vault: PIN entry screen protecting your most sensitive encrypted notes" class="blog-screenshot" width="1080" height="2128" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="blog-screenshot-caption">PIN lock and Private Vault — an extra layer on top of automatic encryption</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>On top of automatic encryption, you can set a PIN lock for the whole app and move your most sensitive notes into a Private Vault — a separate, hidden space that's only accessible with your PIN.</p>

            <h2>The Honest Comparison</h2>

            <p>I'm not going to pretend Scrib does everything Google Keep does. It doesn't. Here's a straight comparison:</p>

                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>If you need collaboration, web access, and cross-device sync — Keep is the better tool for that. No question.</p>

            <p>If you want your notes encrypted on your device, with zero data collection, no cloud, no account, and nobody holding a copy of your encryption key — that's what Scrib is built for.</p>

            <p>Different tools for different priorities.</p>
