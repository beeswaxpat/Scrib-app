            <p>Think about what's in your notes app right now. Passwords. Addresses. Medical info. Bank account numbers. Business ideas. Journal entries you'd never want anyone else to read.</p>

            <p>Now think about where those notes are stored — and whether anything is protecting them.</p>

            <p>If the answer is "I'm not sure," that's exactly the problem.</p>

            <h2>Your Notes Are a Goldmine</h2>

            <p>Most people don't think of their notes app as sensitive. It's not a banking app. It's not email. But look at what actually ends up in there:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Wi-Fi passwords and account credentials</li>
                <li>Social Security numbers and ID info</li>
                <li>Medical notes and prescriptions</li>
                <li>Business ideas and financial plans</li>
                <li>Personal journal entries and private thoughts</li>
                <li>Addresses, phone numbers, contacts</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is some of the most valuable data on your phone. And for most people, it's sitting in an app with zero encryption.</p>

            <h2>What Can Go Wrong</h2>

            <p><strong>Your phone gets stolen.</strong> If your notes aren't encrypted, anyone who gets past your lock screen has everything. Lock screens can be bypassed — encryption can't.</p>

            <p><strong>Your cloud account gets breached.</strong> If your notes sync to the cloud, they're only as secure as your account password. One phishing email, one reused password from a data breach — and your notes are exposed.</p>

            <p><strong>Someone borrows your phone.</strong> You hand it to a friend to show them a photo. They swipe into your notes app. Maybe intentionally, maybe not. If there's no PIN lock, everything's visible.</p>

            <p><strong>An app has too many permissions.</strong> Some apps request broad storage access. If your notes are stored as plain text, other apps could potentially access them.</p>

            <h2>What Encryption Actually Does</h2>

            <p>AES-256 encryption scrambles your data so it's unreadable without the correct key. Even if someone gets physical access to your phone's storage — pulls the files directly — they see garbled data, not your notes.</p>

            <p>The critical detail: <strong>where is the encryption key stored?</strong></p>

            <p>If the key lives on a company's server, they can decrypt your data whenever they want. If the key lives on your device in a hardware-secured area (like the Android Keystore), only your phone can decrypt it. No one else holds a copy.</p>

            <p>That's the difference between "we encrypt your data" and actual privacy.</p>

            <h2>What to Look For in a Notes App</h2>

            <p>If privacy matters to you, here's the baseline:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>AES-256 encryption at rest</strong> — notes are encrypted on the device, not just during transfer</li>
                <li><strong>Device-only key storage</strong> — the encryption key stays on your phone, ideally in a hardware-backed keystore</li>
                <li><strong>No cloud requirement</strong> — if there's no server, there's nothing to breach</li>
                <li><strong>No account required</strong> — no email or phone number means no identity tied to your data</li>
                <li><strong>PIN lock or biometric lock</strong> — a second barrier before anyone can open the app</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Anything less, and you're betting that nothing will ever go wrong.</p>

            <h2>How Scrib Handles This</h2>

            <p>I built <a href="https://scrib.cfd/">Scrib</a> to meet every one of those requirements. Here's how it works:</p>

            <p><strong>Two layers of encryption.</strong> Every note is automatically AES-256 encrypted the moment it's saved — that's the base layer, always on, no setup required. On top of that, you can toggle per-note encryption for your most sensitive notes, adding a second layer of AES-256 protection.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../home-screen.jpg" alt="Scrib Android app home screen showing color-coded notes with encryption lock icons in dark mode" class="blog-screenshot" width="1080" height="2141" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="blog-screenshot-caption">Lock icons show which notes have extra per-note encryption enabled</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The encryption key is generated on your phone and stored in the Android Keystore — a hardware-backed secure area that other apps can't access. Scrib never connects to the internet. There is no server. No sync. No networking code in the app at all.</p>

            <p>You can also set a PIN lock for the whole app and move sensitive notes into a Private Vault — a separate, hidden space only accessible with your PIN.</p>

            <p>Zero data collected. No account needed. Just encrypted notes on your device.</p>
